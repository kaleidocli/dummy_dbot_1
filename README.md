FAQ for Setting up a profile: (Updated 05/22/2020)
+ How to get channel's ID and server's ID?
Step 1: Settings > Appearance > Turn on "Developer Mode"
Step 2: Right click on channel and choose "Copy ID". For server ID, do the same thing except clicking on server icon or banner.

+ How to get user's Token or bot's Token?
If you don't know how to create a bot, google it. Once you have a bot, you can use that token to post images.
If you don't know how to get the token of a USER, google it. Same thing as the bot.

+ A bot or a user?
In short, either you use a BOT ACCOUNT to post images, or use an USER ACCOUNT to post images (aka. self-bot).
Self-bot is against Discord's ToS, and will definitely get you banned if you get snitched.

+ Which one to use?
Technically, there's no difference between the two.
